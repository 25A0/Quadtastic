This is a little LÃ–VE tool to handle sprite atlases while keeping your sanity.

## Roadmap

 - [x] Load the image
 - [x] Display the image
 - [x] zoom and move the image around
 - [ ] Define quads
 - [ ] Name quads
 - [ ] Export defined quads as lua code
 - [ ] Detect and import existing quad definitions
